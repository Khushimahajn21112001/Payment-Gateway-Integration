 This Donation is for health care and education of poor and needy children.Your small gift will help us create sustainable and ever lasting impact for children, families and the entire communities.Sparks foundation provides support to over 20,000 children living in vulnerable communities in remote areas of India. These children are at the risk of getting abandoned or losing parental care as their families are unable to provide proper food & nutrition due to their financial conditions.Once you donate, we will send you the name and photo of the person you are supporting as well as periodic progress reports about them.
